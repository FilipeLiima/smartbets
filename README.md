## Problem

- Fraud and manipulation: A betting industry constantly faces the challenge of fraud and manipulation of results.
- Risk management: The volatile nature of betting can expose houses to significant financial risks. Unforeseen fluctuations in the results of events.
- Cyber ​​security: Bookmakers are frequent targets of cyber attacks, including theft of customer data, account takeovers and manipulation of payment systems.
- Competition and customer retention: the betting market is highly competitive, with many houses vying for bettors' attention. Maintaining customer loyalty and attracting new players requires strategic marketing strategies, offering competitive odds and an exceptional user experience.

## Solution

- Transparency and trust: Blockchain technology offers an immutable and transparent record of all transactions and activities on the betting platform.
- Security of funds: With smart contracts and crypto wallets, users have greater control over their funds and transactions.
- Reduced costs: Eliminating intermediaries and automating processes through smart contracts can significantly reduce operational costs.
- Global access and financial inclusion: The decentralized nature of web 3.0 allows for global access, regardless of geographic borders or financial barriers.
- Personalization and community governance: Users can have a say in important decisions, such as rule changes or revenue distribution, through decentralized voting mechanisms

## Next steps

- Implement performance improvements and connect VRF to provide more transparency to the NFT draw.
- Launch the product to the public and study improvements in tokenomics and ERC20 token staking.
- Obtain feedback, adjust product design as necessary and implement other types of bets.
